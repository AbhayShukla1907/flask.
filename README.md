# Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to automate the deployment process of a Flask application using Jenkins. The application is hosted on GitHub, and Jenkins is used to build, test, and deploy the application automatically upon code changes.

# Technologies Used
. Flask: A micro web framework written in Python.
. Git: Version control system to manage and track changes in the codebase.
. GitHub: Remote repository for hosting the project.
. Jenkins: Open-source automation server used to automate parts of the software development process.
. Python: Programming language used to build the Flask application.

# Installation and Setup
## Local Environment Setup

1. Install Python:
  
       sudo apt update
       sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
2. Install Flask:

       pip3 install flask

     . Flask Sample Repo

# Jenkins Setup
## Installing Jenkins
To install Jenkins on Ubuntu
1. Update package index:

       sudo apt update
2. Install Java (Jenkins requires Java to run):

       sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
![Screenshot 2024-10-25 180712](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04f2a4c5-7e5c-42c1-b77e-88f62e327f80)

4. Add Jenkins repository and install Jenkins:

       curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \
           /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
       sudo sh -c 'echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
           https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ > \
          /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
       sudo apt update
       sudo apt install jenkins

5. Start Jenkins:

       sudo systemctl start jenkins
Visit http://localhost:8080 and complete the setup by using the initial admin password:
         
    sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

## Creating a Jenkinsfile
The Jenkinsfile defines the CI/CD pipeline stages for Flask application. Here's a basic example:

           pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Install dependencies
                    sh 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Run tests with pytest
                    sh 'pytest tests/'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            when {
                expression {
                    return currentBuild.result == null || currentBuild.result == 'SUCCESS'
                }
            }
            steps {
                script {
                    // For now, simply echoing a success message.
                    // You can replace this with actual deployment steps.
                    echo "Deploying the Flask application!"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    post {
        always {
            // Clean workspace after build
            cleanWs()
        }
        success {
            // Notify on successful build
            mail to: 'abhay06072002@gmail.com
                 subject: "SUCCESS: Jenkins Build #${env.BUILD_NUMBER}",
                 body: "The build has been successfully completed!"
        }
        failure {
            // Notify on failed build
            mail to: 'abhay06072002@gmail.com',
                 subject: "FAILURE: Jenkins Build #${env.BUILD_NUMBER}",
                 body: "The build failed."
        }
    }
}

This Jenkinsfile performs the following tasks:

. Clone repository: It pulls the latest code from the GitHub repository.
. Install dependencies: Installs required dependencies listed in "requirements.txt."
. Run Tests: Runs unit tests.
. Deploy: Placeholder for deployment steps.

## Configuring Pipeline Triggers
To set up GitHub Webhooks and configure Pipeline Triggers:
![Screenshot 2024-10-26 213007](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad05e0ef-73bd-4aa1-882f-35da89b9faa6)

1. Install the "GitHub Integration" plugin in Jenkins.
2. Configure Webhook in GitHub:
. Go to your repository's settings.
. Under Webhooks, click Add webhook.
. Set the Payload URL to http://192.168.43.62:8080/github-webhook/.
. Set Content Type to application/json.
. Choose Just the push event for triggering the webhook.

4. Configure Jenkins Job:
. Create a Pipeline job in Jenkins.
. Under Build Triggers, select GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling.

##  Testing the Pipeline
Once Jenkins pipeline is configured:
1. Make changes to Flask repository.
2. Push the changes to GitHub:

       git add .
       git commit -m "Made some changes"
       git push origin main

3. Jenkins will automatically detect the changes via the webhook and trigger the build.

# GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline for Flask App
This project demonstrates how to implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for a Flask web application. The pipeline includes steps for testing, building, and deploying the app to staging and production environments.

## Objectives
. Set up a CI/CD pipeline for a Python Flask app using GitHub Actions.
. Automate testing and deployment to both staging and production environments.

## Prerequisites
. A GitHub repository with the Python Flask application.
. main and staging branches in the repository.
. GitHub Actions enabled for the repository.
. GitHub Secrets for storing sensitive information such as API tokens or deployment keys.
## Setup
### Create staging Branch:

##  GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration
### Create the Directory:

    cd flask.
    mkdir -p .github/workflows
### Create a YAML File:
Inside the .github/workflows folder, create a file called ci-cd.yml.

    touch .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml

### Define GitHub Actions Workflow
Hereâ€™s the detailed YAML configuration for your CI/CD pipeline:
      
      name: CI/CD Pipeline for Flask App

    # This triggers the workflow on push to the staging or main branch, or when a release is created
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - staging
          - main
      release:
        types: [created]

    jobs:
      # Step 1: Install Dependencies
      install-dependencies:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
          - name: Set up Python
            uses: actions/setup-python@v2
            with:
              python-version: '3.x'

          - name: Install dependencies
            run: |
              python -m pip install --upgrade pip
              pip install -r requirements.txt

      # Step 2: Run Tests
      run-tests:
        needs: install-dependencies
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
          - name: Run tests
            run: pytest

      # Step 3: Build the Flask app
      build:
        needs: run-tests
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        if: success()
        steps:
          - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
          - name: Build Flask app
            run: echo "Building the Flask app"

      # Step 4: Deploy to Staging Environment
      deploy-staging:
        needs: build
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/staging'
        steps:
          - name: Deploy to Staging
            run: echo "Deploying to Staging Environment"

      # Step 5: Deploy to Production Environment
      deploy-production:
        needs: build
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        if: github.event_name == 'release'
        steps:
          - name: Deploy to Production
            run: echo "Deploying to Production Environment"

   ### GitHub Secrets
Need to configure GitHub Secrets for any sensitive information that pipeline needs, such as:
. API Tokens for accessing external services.
. Deployment Keys for secure deployment.

## Workflow Execution
. Push to Staging Branch: Any changes pushed to the staging branch trigger the workflow for staging deployment.
. Push to Main Branch: Changes on the main branch only build and test the application.
. Release Tag: When a new release is tagged, it triggers a production deployment

##  Monitoring Workflow
Go to the Actions tab in GitHub repository to monitor and troubleshoot each step of the workflow.

## Example Run
. Push to Staging: The app is deployed to staging.
. Release Tag: Production deployment triggers after tagging a release.







   
# Conclusion
By following these steps, we successfully set up a CI/CD pipeline for Flask application using Jenkins. Each time code is pushed to the GitHub repository, Jenkins will automatically run the pipeline, test the code, and deploy it.
